4 initial questions about sets, lists, tuples, dictionaries (1 each at the beginning)

class= cookie cutter, the base for objects to be created
class MyClass
    x = 5


p1 = Myclass()
print(p1.x)



to encapsulate
 set variables to private by adding __ to self.__name or such
 then add getters and setters (which are called constructors)
 if this "def __str__(self):" is not there, calling the function would show its location


 inheritance = generalization
 parent has generalized classes while the child class has specialization while inheriting the parent's attributes

 non-private functions also get inherited by the child class
 refer back to the vehicle.py files to review reuse-ability and inheritance

 It is multiple choice for the most part (95% multiple choice)

Recursion- "it is bad from a performance perspective. better to use a while loop for that reason"

base case- so it doesn't loop forever. like below
def main():
    message()

def message():
    print("this message prints forever")

main()

self.name = name
self.age = age
data members = (self.name and self.age)


def __init__ is called a initializer or constructor
